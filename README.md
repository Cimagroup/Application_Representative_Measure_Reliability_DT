# Representative Datasets

> Perera Lago, J., Toscano Dur√°n, V., Paluzo-Hidalgo, E., Narteni, S. & Rucco, M.  Application of the representative measure
approach to assess the reliability of decision trees in dealing with unseen vehicle collision data 

Two experiments were developed:

1. Synthetic Dataset,
2. Vehicle Collision Dataset. 

In both four sets were considered, the train set, two random subsets generated from the train set and the test test.

### List of main needed libraries

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn

To install all the necessary python(we use Python 3.11.6) dependencies to run these experiments use the next command:

```bash
pip install -r requeriments.txt 
```

#### Experiments were run on a computer with AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS with Radeon Graphics CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 with 8 GB of RAM GPU
